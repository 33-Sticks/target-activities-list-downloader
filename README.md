# Target Activities List Downloader

A script that downloads the list of Target activities to a CSV file. By default, it's named using the format `targetActivities_${unixTimestamp}.csv`

## Usage

1. Open Target to the Activities tab (e.g. <https://experience.adobe.com/#/@33sticksexchange/target/activities>)
2. Adjust the filters to display only the activies you want to capture.
3. Scroll all the way down to ensure all X of N activities are loaded (i.e. `18 of 18 Activities`).
4. Open the dev console.
5. Change the JS context to `Main Content (activities.html)`.
   * Target's activities are served in this iframe, and we're unable to access it from `top` due to Adobe's cross-origin policy. Yes, it's a total pain.
6. Copy and paste the contents of [dist/index.js](dist/index.js) into the console and hit Enter
7. (Optional) If your [browser is configured to do so](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95759#:~:text=ask%20where%20to%20save%20each%20file%20before%20downloading), rename and choose download location.
